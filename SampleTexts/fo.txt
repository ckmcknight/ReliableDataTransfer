This paper provides an indepth look into the state of cloud computing services that stem from it and where the technology is headed Cloud computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditized much like gas and electricity are The authors describe the transformation as transforming towards developing software for millions to consume as a service as opposed to something that runs on a computer They provide sophisticated services accessible over the network and are available anywhere However due to their need to be reliable and redundant as well as available all over lots of new data centers have been established as a fundamental need for a successful service Virtual Machines are critical to cloud computing services because they allow isolation of the application from the underlying hardware and suit the diverse needs of the end user Because applications arent directly tailored to a user they need to be adaptable to fit whatever the cloud user needs The authors then discuss various progressions of services beginning at grid computing It enables sharing and aggregation of a wide variety of resources Similar is PeertoPeer which allows peer nodes to directly share content over a decentralized manner The latest paradigm they assert is cloud computing which promises reliable services delivered through nextgeneration data centers The computer utilities vision is becoming a reality with the focus on cloud computing because were seeing the formation of a worldwide system of computer networks that enables communication from anywhere Cloud computing enhances this connectivity by providing ondemand data access and robust alwaysavailable infrastructure One big component of cloud computing is marketoriented cloud architecture which is responsible for meeting specific quality of service needs that businesses require to meet objectives and sustain operations They must regulate supply and demand of cloud resources to maintain equilibrium The researchers suggest there are four main components relevant in the marketoriented architecture This paper provides an indepth look into the state of cloud computing services that stem
