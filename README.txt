Introduction
In this assignment we were given the task to design and implement a client-server application for bidirectional reliable data transfers. Instead of using TCPâ€™s reliable service, we implemented our own connectionless reliable service much like UDP.

Description and Features:
- 3-way handshake: The server is always in a state of listening for a connection request. Once it receives a connection request from a client, the server sends an acknowledgement to the client to confirm it received the connection request. The server will then expect an acknowledgement from the client to confirm the connection. At this stage the connection has been officially made between client and server. This process is commonly known as the 3-way handshake.

- Selective Repeat:
*Client:
*Server:
